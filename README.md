# React-App-Repo
React App Repo that works with Flask React App
# Follow this link to my repo on Github:
# Setup
1. run npx create-react-app react-crud-app. This will create a new project and set up our development environment. It will create a new folder in your current directory for the in-class application. Here's an example of the setup commands:
1. Navigate inside react-cd-app.
1. Create a new component called Hello.js. We need to do this inside the src directory, so let's run: touch src/Hello.js.
1. Open the code in your editor. I'm using visual code studio.

# Once you're ready to run the server:

1. npm run start
1. After running npm run start, we can view the app at http://localhost:3000.
1. npm i react-router-dom
Let's test this:

Run: npm run start
localhost:3000/ should automatically open. If not, navigate there.
Click the "Go to Dogs Page" button. You should be redirected to localhost:3000/dogs
Now you can use the back and forward arrow buttons in your browser to navigate through the history.
